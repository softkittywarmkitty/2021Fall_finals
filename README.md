Economic recession will affect every aspect of life. For job seekers and employees, the direct impact of the recession is the reduction of job positions, or even worse, layoffs from the company. 

We found an article published in 2012, which divided the companies into three categories and mainly studied the changing trend of job positions of private companies in the market and the resilience speed of those companies after the economy has passed. 

Since this article was published in 2012, Covid-19 did not appear. The impact of the Covid-19 on the economy in recent years is not negligible. We want to add the Covid-19 daily infection case trend in the US dataset and daily vaccinated number (or rate) dataset from the CDC website to see how the law of change follows.

Dataset Involved:

COVID-19 daily cases trend in the U.S. dataset: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases

Hypothesis:
1. The number of Covid-19 cases in the United States was negatively correlated with employment opportunities at the beginning, but over time, the increase in cases will not affect employment opportunities.
2. In general, big companies have better resilience capabilities after the epidemic pass.
3. The increase in the coverage of the Covid-19 vaccination does not bring more job opportunities.
